I'm a software engineer and architect. I care deeply about using technology to empower individuals, using a combination of web technology, open data formats, and cryptography.
</p>

<p>
I am the Executive Director of <a href="https://voting.works">VotingWorks</a>. Previously, I led Engineering at <a href="https://clever.com">Clever</a>, Seller Engineering at <a href="https://squareup.com">Square</a>, the Identity Team and <a href="https://persona.org">Mozilla Persona</a> project at <a href="http://mozilla.com">Mozilla</a>. I used to be an academic and ran a couple of small bootstrapped startups.

<p>
I created and maintain the <a href="http://heliosvoting.org">Helios Voting System</a>.

<p>
I co-created the <a href="http://rdfa.info">RDFa</a> structured data standard.
</p>

<p>
I used to be on the Board of <a href="http://creativecommons.org">Creative Commons</a>, an organization that I continue to care about deeply.
</p>

<p>
I received a PhD in Computer Science from the Cryptography and Information Security group at <a href="http://mit.edu">MIT</a>, where I was advised by <a href="http://people.csail.mit.edu/rivest/">Ron Rivest</a>.
